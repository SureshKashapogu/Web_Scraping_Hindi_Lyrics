# Web_Scraping_Hindi_Lyrics
Scraping Hindi Lyrics from multiple pages of a website using BeautifulSoup library in Jupyter Notebook
We have a website which consists of lyrics of the songs from bollywood movies written by song writer 'Shailendra'
These lyrics are present in multiple pages.
Using BeautifulSoup library, we have scraped the lyrics by inspecting the element and finding the tags.
As the result, we got hindi as well as English lyrics along with metadata such as movie, year, singers, music director.
